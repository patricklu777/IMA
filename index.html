The plot is somewhat similar to that of a unit play, with one story per sentence, each time a story between Violet and a different person, from a colleague to a person <br>who asks to write for her, from a humble soldier to a noble royal princess<br>she meets people with different identities and experiences different feelings.<br>
The final words end not with Violet and XX (a different character), but with Violet and Love.</p>
