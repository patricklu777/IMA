<h2>Highlights</h2>
The plot is somewhat similar to that of a unit play, with one story per sentence, each time a story between Violet and a different person, from a colleague to a person <br>who asks to write for her, from a humble soldier to a noble royal princess, she meets people with different identities and experiences different feelings.<br>
The final words end not with Violet and XX (a different character), but with Violet and Love.</p>

<h2>Deliver the sunshine</h2>
<p>The title Violet's Garden of Eternity is actually the language of the flower, Violet is the violet, and the violet represents eternal love, so the title could also be "Violet's Love Eternal"</p>
