<p> Violet Evergarden<br>
Violet is a former soldier who was enlisted in the Leidenschaftlich army and fought in the war, where she was treated as nothing more than a weapon<br>
Back when she was a child, Violet was found on a deserted island alone after Dietfried Bougainvillea and his comrades' ship became stranded. She didn't have a name at the time, and Dietfried was unsure if she had become orphaned or if she had suffered an accident in the sea just like them.</p>
